Throughout the regression analysis presented in this repository, we will be following Andrew Ng's "data-driven AI" paradigm.
That is, we will be sticking with simple linear regression as our model throughout the bulk of the analysis and will be using
iterations of its application to aid in the feature selection and construction process. A schematic of this idea is depicted in the
flow diagram below: the output of the simple linear regression is used to modify the original data set to improve downstream applications of the same simple linear regression.
